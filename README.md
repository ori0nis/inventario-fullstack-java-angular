## Welcome to Sistema de Inventarios, my first ever fullstack project featuring Java, Springboot and Angular! ðŸš€

I am very pleased to release what is my first full approach to web programming.

Sistema de Inventarios is a very simple web app that manages products that are allocated in an SQL database, and serves them using Springboot, JPA and Angular.

I had a lot of fun coding this project, and it helped me realize just how fun web programming is, and how much I love it!

Sistema de Inventarios was also my first project that required learning how to use ![Postman](https://img.shields.io/badge/Postman-orange.svg?style=flat&logo=postman&logoColor=white)

This app was created following Ubaldo Acosta's lead during his "Universidad Java" masterclass.
